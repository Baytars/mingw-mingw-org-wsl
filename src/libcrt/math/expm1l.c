 * F2XM1's input is constrained to (-1, +1), so the domain of
 * 'x * LOG2EL' is (-LOGE2L, +LOGE2L). Outside that domain,
 * delegating to expl() handles C99 7.12.6.3/2 range errors.
 *
 * Constants from moshier.net, file cephes/ldouble/constl.c,
 * are used instead of M_LN2 and M_LOG2E, which would not be
 * visible with 'gcc std=c99'.  The use of these extended precision
 * constants also allows gcc to replace them with x87 opcodes.
