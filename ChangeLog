	We are going to assume that MinGW is using GCC version greater than or
	equal to 3.5.4 and remove any filters related to earlier versions. We
	are also going to remove any possibility of using a compiler other than
	GCC.

	possibility of using a compiler other than GCC and remove any other
	needless filters.
